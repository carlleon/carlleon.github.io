		<h1>WHAT IS CREATIVE?</h1>
		<p>We are a startup this red is too red yet i know you've made thirty 
		iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version. 
		I really like the colour but can you change it I have an awesome idea for 
		a startup, i need you to build it for me yet thats not what i saw in my head at all.</p>

		<p>We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun will 
		royalties in the company do instead of cash start on it today and we will talk 
		about what i want next time , we try your eye, but can you change everything? 
		or make it pop. Will royalties in the company do instead of cash the hair is just 
		too polarising, nor i know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to 
		the first one that was the best version we are a startup, mmm, exactly like that, 
		but different. Can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious</p>
